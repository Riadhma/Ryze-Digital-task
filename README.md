# Ryze Digital task

Thank you for the task with I enjoyed it ðŸ˜€

In this task I used Bootstrap for the styling and Font Awesome for the icons.

For the routing, I define the routing in `./src/route/routes.js` and the guard route inside `./src/route/router.js`.

I created a service for managing the LocalStorage (set, get, remove) which you can find in `./src/services/storage.service.js`.

You can find the views **Login** and **Details page** inside `./src/views`. and for the components **Form** and **Header** inside `./src/components`.

You will find some comments inside the code for different functions.
